## Types of Agile Methodologies

### What is Agile?
Agile is one of the big buzzwords of the IT development industry.
To put it simply, agile development is a different way of managing IT development teams and projects. It is a general philosophy regarding software production. We can think of agile as an umbrella term that encompasses other processes.
There are many types of Agile method, like Scrum, XP(Extreme Programming), Lean, Kanban etc.

### What is the differences and similarities
There are various methodologies that are collectively known as agile.
> **Scrumb:**
Scrum is an implementation of that philosophy pertaining specifically to project management. In the SCRUM methodology a sprint is the basic unit of development. Each sprint is preceded by a planning meeting, where the tasks for the sprint are identified and an estimated commitment for the sprint goal is made, and followed by a review or retrospective meeting where the progress is reviewed and lessons for the next sprint are identified. During each sprint, the team creates finished portions of a product.

> **XP (Extreme Programming):**
Extreme Programming is a type of agile software development, it advocates frequent "releases" in short development cycles, which is intended to improve productivity and introduce checkpoints where new customer requirements can be adopted.

> **Lean:**
Lean is a production practice that considers the expenditure of resources for any goal other than the creation of value for the end customer to be wasteful, and thus a target for elimination. Working from the perspective of the customer who consumes a product or service, "value" is defined as any action or process that a customer would be willing to pay for. Lean is centered on preserving value with less work.

> **Kanban:**
The name 'Kanban' originates from Japanese[看板], and translates roughly as "signboard" or "billboard". Kanban is a system to control the logistical chain from a production point of view, and is not an inventory control system. It uses a work-in-progress limited pull system as the core mechanism to expose system operation (or process) problems and stimulate collaboration to continuously improve the system.

### Conclusion
Agile development can be a very exciting and invigorating approach, although some projects suit agile more than others.  The collaboration and visibility can provide a much richer and more rewarding experience for teams to develop great software products. Agile development can be a lot more enjoyable than the waterfall approach, which requires lots more documentation and is less flexible by its nature. And when people enjoy their work, it’s amazing what they can achieve!
